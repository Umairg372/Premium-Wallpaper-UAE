## 📝 Image Naming Tips:

**Good names:**
- `modern-blue-geometric.jpg` ✅
- `classic-floral-pattern.jpg` ✅
- `kids-nursery-stars.jpg` ✅

**Avoid:**
- `image1.jpg` ❌ (too generic)
- `download (1).jpg` ❌ (better: `classic-wallpaper-1.jpg`)

**Best practice:**
- Use descriptive names with hyphens
- Include color in name if possible (helps auto-detection)
- Example: `classic-vintage-blue.jpg`

---

## 🔍 Supported Formats:

- `.jpg` / `.jpeg` ✅
- `.png` ✅
- `.webp` ✅
- `.gif` ✅

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

1. **File size**: Keep images under 2MB for fast loading
2. **Aspect ratio**: Portrait (height > width) works best
3. **Resolution**: 800x1200px or higher recommended
4. **Refresh**: After pasting, refresh your browser to see new images

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

**Image not showing?**
1. Check that file is in the correct folder
2. Make sure file extension is correct (.jpg, .png, etc.)
3. Refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 for hard refresh)
4. Restart development server if needed

**Want to rename?**
- Just rename the file in the folder
- The system will automatically update the name

**Want to delete?**
